Molesweeper

Project description:
You play as carrot farmer who has to finish harvesting in time. 
Avoid the moles at all costs, because they'll bite you. 
You have to finish your job in a certain amount of time, in order to get paid.


How to:
First, you can choose the difficulty witch which you want to play the game.
You'll see a a wide lawn with different amount of squares. 
It works a bit like minesweeper. 
The mines that display the traps are in this game moles. Click on one and you'll lose.
By clicking on the right square, a carrot will appear and you'll be safe. 
In the top right corner you can see a basket that saves the amount of carrots you have harvevsted. 
There's a timer at the top that counts down.  
If you did it in time you'll get stars. Three is best, one is worst.

(In the beginning you can, according to your preference, switch beetween day- or night time.)
